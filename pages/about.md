I'm currently studying for a master's in precision medicine at UCL. Before that, I did a bachelor's in maths and computer science at Imperial College London.

My overall aim is to help push the field of precision medicine forward using machine learning. There are different ways of approaching this field: my core interests on the machine learning side are *deep generative models* and *mechanistic machine learning*, on the medical side is *complex disease pathology*, and on the healthcare side is building *diagnostic systems* that slot in well to clinical workflows.
