I'm currently studying towards a PhD in AI for Healthcare at Imperial College London. Before that, I did a bachelor's in maths and computer science at Imperial and a master's in precision medicine at UCL. My main PhD project is looking at interpretable, multimodal learning for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

My overall aim is to help push the field of precision medicine forward using machine learning. There are different ways of approaching this field: my core interests on the machine learning side are *deep generative models* and *mechanistic machine learning*, on the medical side is *complex disease pathology*, and on the healthcare side is building *diagnostic systems* that slot in well to clinical workflows.

Outside of all of that, I'm a big music and film fan - my Letterboxd (currently missing an icon) is in the footer next to the YouTube icon.
