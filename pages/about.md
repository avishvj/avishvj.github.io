Hey! I'm Avish and I'm currently studying precision medicine at UCL. Before that, I did a bachelor's in maths and computer science at Imperial College London.

Over the past few years, I've developed a strong interest in molecular medicine and machine learning. My overall aim is to help push the field of precision oncology forward using machine learning. There are different ways of approaching this field: my core interests on the machine learning side are *deep generative models* and *mechanistic machine learning*, on the medical side is *blood cancer biology*, and on the healthcare side is building *diagnostic systems* that slot in well to doctor workflows.
