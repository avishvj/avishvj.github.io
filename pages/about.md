My overall aim is to help push the field of precision medicine forward using machine learning. To this end, I'm studying towards a PhD in AI for Healthcare at Imperial College London. My main PhD project is looking at interpretable, multimodal learning for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Before that, I did a bachelor's in maths and computer science at Imperial and a master's in precision medicine at UCL. 

Outside of all of that, I'm a big music and film fan - my Letterboxd (currently missing an icon) is in the footer next to the YouTube icon. I'm always interested in chatting about work, UK politics, or music/films - get in contact with me via email or Twitter below!
