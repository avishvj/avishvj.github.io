  <h1 class="content-listing-header sans">Translatable Machine Learning for Precision Medicine</h1>

  Broadly, I want to tackle problems in precision medicine using machine learning. One of my key aims in *translatability* - I want to figure out how we can deploy these biomedical machine learning models to a clinical setting.

  <a name="aims"></a>Key aims </font>
  What are we trying to do on the disease biology side? **Understand disease mechanisms in patients.** Use multiomics data and systems medicine techniques to build dynamic disease models for patients. Aim for patient stratification and personalised prognoses.

  What are we trying to do on the drug discovery side? **Identify therapies to remove disease effects.** Systems pharmacology to screen existing drugs, and evaluate their side effects on patients and in combination. Then molecular machine learning and computer-assisted synthesis planning to speed up targeted drug synthesis.
