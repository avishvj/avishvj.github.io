  <h1 class="content-listing-header sans">Translatable Machine Learning for Precision Medicine</h1>

  Broadly, I want to target problems in precision medicine using machine learning. It's a fairly new field that isn't well-defined so I'll post my notes to the areas I'm interested in. One of my key aims in *translatability* - I want to figure out how we can deploy these biomedical machine learning models to a clinical setting.

  <a name="aims"></a>Key aims </font>
  What are we trying to do on the disease biology side? **Understand disease mechanisms in patients.**
  
  * Use multiomics data and systems medicine (i.e. biological patient networks) techniques to build up dynamic multiscale patient models.
  * Understand how disease perturbs regular information flow in the patient networks to create a diagnosis.
  * Identify the stratified disease-causing mechanisms in these networks to create more accurate patient subgroups.
  * Build probabilistic models of disease progression to help provide prognoses and personalised treatment plans.
  

  What are we trying to do on the drug discovery side? **Identify therapies to remove disease perturbations.**

  * Stratified treatments: creating drugs from disease subtypes/patient subgroups.
  * Individualised treatment: going from stratified to individualised with specific mechanism/perturbation-based experiments.
  * Systems pharmacology: investigate drug-target, drug-omics, drug combination effects. Want to screen potential drugs and evaluate side effects, repurpose existing drugs, and synthesise new drugs.
