  <h1 class="content-listing-header sans">Translatable Machine Learning for Precision Medicine</h1>

  Broadly, I want to tackle problems in precision medicine using machine learning. One of my key aims in *translatability* - I want to figure out how we can deploy these biomedical machine learning models to a clinical setting.

  What are we trying to do on the disease biology side? **Understand disease mechanisms in patients.** Build dynamic disease models for patients to stratify them better and determine long-term prognoses.

  What are we trying to do on the drug discovery side? **Identify therapies to remove disease effects.** Systems pharmacology to screen existing drugs, and evaluate their side effects on patients and in combination. Then molecular machine learning and computer-assisted synthesis planning (CASP) to speed up targeted drug synthesis.
