I'm currently studying towards a PhD in AI for Healthcare as part of the third cohort for the [AI4Health CDT](https://ai4health.io/) at Imperial College London. My main PhD project is looking at interpretable, multimodal learning for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, supervised by [Joram M. Posma](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/j.posma11) and [Phil Molyneaux](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/p.molyneaux). Before this, I did a bachelor's in maths and computer science at Imperial and a master's in precision medicine at UCL. My CV is available [here](../assets/files/CV_270422.pdf).

My overall aim is to push the field of precision medicine forward using machine learning. One of my key aims is *translatability* - I want to figure out how we can deploy these biomedical machine learning models to a clinical setting. To this end, I'm also interested in the broader ecosystem of UK healthcare: the NHS (and its various incarnations), how industry (big tech and pharma) interact with the NHS to deliver precision care, and how politics shapes care through healthcare and genomics policy.
