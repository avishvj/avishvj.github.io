**The genre is said to have 'died' once already in its not-even 20 year history, and, with drill and afroswing currenty dominating the UK singles market, how is grime reconciling the pressure of commercialisation with the effort to retain its musical authenticity?**

This phrase gets parroted as soon as a genre loses its initial hype but, in the case of grime, with derivative genres, such as drill and afroswing, currently proving more popular and more prevalent, the question is a valid one. The first question that needs to be asked, though, is whether a sound can ever truly die – the discussion here is really whether grime, and its culture, is still thriving. The answer to this is different across the board: for the fringe listener, ‘dead’ means it doesn’t have airtime on the radio or in the charts; for the casual listener, it means artists in the scene aren’t really producing albums with any consistency; for the serious grime listener, it means that no artists are releasing or doing sets. For grime purists, who fall into the last bracket, the answer is assuredly no. However, for the other listeners, there’s more of an argument for the answer being yes. 
It would be wrong to say that grime is buzzing right now. The resurgence the genre experienced in 2014, led by Skepta and Stormzy, had finished by the end of 2016. By then, these artists were experimenting with more sounds and branching out - Skepta had been co-signed by Drake and Kanye West, and Stormzy, the supposed leader of the new school of grime, released a 16-track album that contained only three ‘pure’ grime songs. 

Even the most ardent grime fan would be hard-pressed to deny that a lot of projects these days lack originality. The lyrical content is wider, but the general sound of grime has changed and is much more influenced by elements of
trap. The abrasive, lo-fi nature of early grime isn’t as prevalent because the attitude towards it is different. Grime was originally a way for disaffected youths in council estates in inner city London to express their emotions but, as the genre achieved a certain level of commercial appeal, many artists grew out of that lifestyle and lost that raw hunger which fuelled their earlier days. Grime, for many artists, was an emotional release that was often hard to recreate - Dizzee Rascal even said he didn’t
want to create another Boy in Da Corner because it reminded him of a dark period in his life.
