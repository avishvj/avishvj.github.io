**The genre is said to have 'died' once already in its not-even 20 year history, and, with drill and afroswing currenty dominating the UK singles market, how is grime reconciling the pressure of commercialisation with the effort to retain its musical authenticity?**

This phrase gets parroted as soon as a genre loses its initial hype but, in the case of grime, with derivative genres, such as drill and afroswing, currently proving more popular and more prevalent, the question is a valid one. The first question that needs to be asked, though, is whether a sound can ever truly die – the discussion here is really whether grime, and its culture, is still thriving. The answer to this is different across the board: for the fringe listener, ‘dead’ means it doesn’t have airtime on the radio or in the charts; for the casual listener, it means artists in the scene aren’t really producing albums with any consistency; for the serious grime listener, it means that no artists are releasing or doing sets. For grime purists, who fall into the last bracket, the answer is assuredly no. However, for the other listeners, there’s more of an argument for the answer being yes. 

It would be wrong to say that grime is buzzing right now. The resurgence the genre experienced in 2014, led by Skepta and Stormzy, had finished by the end of 2016. By then, these artists were experimenting with more sounds and branching out - Skepta had been co-signed by Drake and Kanye West, and Stormzy, the supposed leader of the new school of grime, released a 16-track album that contained only three ‘pure’ grime songs. 

Even the most ardent grime fan would be hard-pressed to deny that a lot of projects these days lack originality. The lyrical content is wider, but the general sound of grime has changed and is much more influenced by elements of
trap. The abrasive, lo-fi nature of early grime isn’t as prevalent because the attitude towards it is different. Grime was originally a way for disaffected youths in council estates in inner city London to express their emotions but, as the genre achieved a certain level of commercial appeal, many artists grew out of that lifestyle and lost that raw hunger which fuelled their earlier days. Grime, for many artists, was an emotional release that was often hard to recreate - Dizzee Rascal even said he didn’t want to create another *Boy in Da Corner* because it reminded him of a dark period in his life.

Luckily, even if the majority don’t, enough artists are producing cohesive grime albums that the critics in the UK are forced to take some notice. A grime album has appeared in the nominations for the Mercury Prize each of the past three years, with Skepta’s *Konnichiwa* even winning the 2016 award. Novelist’s 2018 Mercury-nominated album, *Novelist Guy*, showcases his own, more experimental form of grime that is heavily influenced by early Dizzee Rascal. His album, amongst other efforts this past year from Maxsta, Manga, Mez, and Skepta, prove that cohesive and boundary-pushing grime albums are still being created and recognised in the world of UK music.

Grime definitely isn’t dead in the eyes of the media. Two of the biggest producers in the scene, Sir Spyro and Rude Kid, both headline a weekly grime radio show on BBC 1Xtra and Kiss FM, respectively. Many thought that pure grime could never be mainstream because of how rough and aggressive it is, but the support of these two popular radio stations proves that the sound has evolved to capture the ears of people outside of the original scene. The rapid flows and sparse beats may not appeal straight away to the casual music listener, but the ethos of grime draws a lot of parallels with punk, metal, and techno.

It is also important to mention grime’s live presence. Very few genres rival grime in terms of energy – an Eskimo Dance, for example, would sit amongst some of the best gigs in any genre. Grime artists, such as P Money, are still selling out shows all over Europe and beyond. The  audiences are growing, not dwindling, which suggests that grime is, in fact, thriving.

Grime has become synonymous with Black British music and has been used as an umbrella term for derivative genres, such as drill, afroswing and UK rap/ hip-hop (although this could be described as grime-adjacent). With that being said, it could be argued that grime can never die because, even though ‘pure’ grime is no longer as prevalent, its influence pervades these popular genres. It’s easy to draw parallels with hip-hop. Across the pond, ‘mumble rap’ has recently had its time in the limelight and, although many hip-hop purists would disagree, it has widely been accepted as almost being a sub-genre of hip-hop and indicative of hip-hop’s evolution, rather
than its death. In many ways, grime can be seen as the UK’s answer to hip-hop and, similarly, the presence and popularity of derivative genres or sub-genres should be seen as an inevitable offshoot of an evolving genre, not a sign that grime is dead.

Alongside its wider appeal, the grime scene has proved its resilience. The scene took a big hit when Radar Radio, a station that pushed authentic UK music: from grime to garage to drill, closed down. Yet, a year later, all the major presenters from that station, have moved on to even larger platforms: Big Zuu and Kenny Allstar have moved to BBC 1Xtra, Snoochie Shy moved to Boiler Room before joining her previous co-stars on 1Xtra, alongside a spot on MTV. Grime has taken many hits and still kept going.

It isn’t the first time grime has “died” either. Grime supposedly died in the mid-to-late 2000s before making its comeback in 2014. Suppose it has now “died” again; it’s possible that the situation may be different this time since we live in a vastly different musical climate, where streaming services have taken over and singles are valued more than albums. But the era of streaming has also made grime far more accessible than it was before. Grime has spread from council estates in East London to countries that don’t even speak English like Russia, Japan and Brazil. The pioneer of grime, Wiley, was given an MBE last year for services to music and received an Ivor Novello Inspiration award this year - a reflection that grime and its culture has truly come full circle.

In conclusion, grime isn’t dead. Sure, it’s taken a backseat while afroswing and drill have taken over but, if a genre were truly dead, there wouldn’t even be cause for debate - there’s a reason this article isn’t ‘Is funky dead?’. The culture is too big now for grime to ever truly die and, if history is anything to go by, it's lying in wait, ready to come back stronger than ever.
